# cloneML

I tried to replicate the app “TapTapSee” features, which help blind people to recognize things near them, doing it with a very well trained machine learning.

I did it because I wanted to understand more about what’s behind machine learning and coreML.

Because of this i trained a machine with a very little dataset of pictures, but going on in the project, to let the app work, i used an official generic dataset from the [**Apple Developer site**](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/), called *MobileNetV2*.
